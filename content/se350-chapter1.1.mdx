# Chapter 1.1 Summary — Processor, Interrupts, and I/O

## Computer System Overview
- OS manages resources using hardware mechanisms  
- Understanding basic hardware is essential (especially for labs)

## Basic Computer Organization

### Components
- CPU, Memory, I/O Devices, Interconnect (bus)

### Control and Status Registers
- **Invisible to users** but essential for processor control
- Examples:
  - `PC` (Program Counter): address of next instruction
  - `IR` (Instruction Register): currently fetched instruction
  - `SP` (Stack Pointer): top of the stack
  - `MAR`/`MBR`: address and data transfer
  - `PSW` (Program Status Word): flags like zero, overflow, supervisor mode

### User-Visible Registers
- Accessible to all programs
- Controlled by compilers or explicitly via C keywords (e.g. `register`, `volatile`)

## Program Execution

### Instruction Cycle (Simplified)
1. Fetch from memory  
2. Execute instruction

### Reality (Modern CPUs)
- Pipelines, VLIW, Superscalar

### Categories of Instructions
- Processor-memory, processor-I/O, data processing, control (e.g. branching)

## Interrupts

- **Used to handle slower I/O devices efficiently**  
- **Interrupt = signal to pause and run a different routine**

### Classes
- Timer, I/O, software exceptions, faults

### Interrupt Cycle
1. Check for interrupt  
2. Save current context (snapshot)  
3. Jump to interrupt handler  
4. Return and restore context

## ARM Cortex-M Specifics

### Execution Modes
- Thread Mode (user tasks)  
- Handler Mode (interrupts and faults)

### Stack Usage
- `PSP` for threads, `MSP` for kernel/handlers

### Special Registers
- `PSR`, `Control`, access via MRS/MSR (privileged only)

### Exception Handling
- Prioritized (Reset > NMI > HardFault > others)  
- Vector table holds handler addresses

<Image src="/photos/se350/chapter1/exception-return.png" width={650} height={320} alt="Exception Entry and Return" />

### Supervisor Call (SVC)
- System calls using `SVC #imm`  
- Parameters in R0–R3 or stack  
- Danger: unchecked access = privilege escalation

## OS and Interrupts (UNIX/Linux)

1. Device driver registered  
2. Library call (e.g. `write`)  
3. Interrupt triggers ISR in driver

## Multiple Interrupts

### Approaches:
- Disable interrupts during handling (bad for timing)  
- Use priority levels (better)

## Multiprogramming

- Run other programs while waiting on I/O  
- Scheduler decides which process to run next

## I/O Communication Techniques

### 1. Programmed I/O
- Busy waiting; CPU polls status

### 2. Interrupt-Driven I/O
- CPU only works when device is ready  
- Still goes through CPU (overhead)
- Still consumes a lot of processor
time, because every word read/write passes through the
processor (two instructions)

### 3. DMA (Direct Memory Access)
- Block transfer bypassing CPU  
- Sends interrupt only on completion
