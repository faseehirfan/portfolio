# Lecture 2 - Engineering Tests

**Date:** *January 8, 2025*  

## Why Tests?

- Tests provide assurance that code works.
- Automated tests allow for faster feedback compared to manual testing.
- Not writing tests incurs **technical debt**, making future maintenance harder.
- Code that lasts years without tests will accumulate bugs unnoticed.
- **Key takeaway:** If it matters that the code works, write a test for it.

## Exploratory Testing

- Typically done by dedicated testers, but useful for developers as well.
- **Exploratory testing = Learning + Test Design + Execution**.
- **Contrasted with scripted testing:**
  - Scripted testing follows predefined steps.
  - Exploratory testing adapts based on findings.
- **Best for:**
  - Rapid feedback on new features.
  - Finding the most critical bug quickly.
  - Evaluating risks before writing scripted tests.

### Process:
1. Define a **charter** (broad testing goal).
2. Choose an area of the software to test.
3. Design a test informally.
4. Execute and log findings.
5. Repeat as needed.

## Regression Testing

Ensures that new changes **don’t break existing functionality**.
  - **Automated**: Manual regression testing is inefficient.
  - **Optimally sized**: Too few = missed bugs, too many = slow execution.
  - **Up-to-date**: Must match the current version of the software.

Automating Regression Tests
- Input:
  - File-based inputs simplify regression testing.
  - UI-based tests often use event capture and replay.
- Output:
  - Comparing screenshots (e.g., Mozilla's testing of Gecko engine) is problematic due to **nondeterminism**.
  - A more reliable approach is **logging-based verification**.

## Unit Testing

- **Focuses on individual components** (functions, classes, or modules).
- **Must be fast** to execute.
- Use **mocks** and **stubs** to isolate components.

### Example Test Structure (NUnit - C#)
```csharp
[Test]
public void GetMinimum_UnsortedArray_ReturnsSmallestValue() {
    var arr = new int[] {7, 4, 9, 2, 5};
    var minimum = Statistics.GetMinimum(arr);
    Assert.AreEqual(2, minimum);
}
```
- **Structure:**
  1. **Arrange** - Set up test data.
  2. **Act** - Execute the function.
  3. **Assert** - Verify the output.

## Flaky Tests

- **Flaky tests fail inconsistently**.
- **Common causes:**
  1. Improper waiting for async responses.
  2. Concurrency issues (race conditions, deadlocks).
  3. Test order dependencies (tests rely on prior tests).
- **Fixes:** Use explicit waits instead of `sleep()`, proper locking mechanisms, and independent test cases.

## Test Doubles

- Used to **isolate dependencies** in unit tests.
- Types:
  - **Dummy objects**: Only fill parameter lists, do nothing.
  - **Fakes**: Implement real behavior but unsuitable for production.
  - **Stubs**: Return predefined responses.
  - **Mocks**: Verify method calls and behavior.
  - **Spies**: Record interactions but wrap real objects.

## Mocking Example (jMock - Java)
```java
Mock warehouse = mock(Warehouse.class);
Mock mailer = mock(MailService.class);
order.setMailer((MailService) mailer.proxy());
mailer.expects(once()).method("send");
```

## Key Takeaways

- **Testing is essential** for maintainable software.
- **Automate everything**: Regression tests should always be automated.
- **Unit tests** should be small and isolated.
- **Flaky tests must be fixed** to maintain reliability.
- **Mock dependencies** for more effective unit testing.

# Lecture 3 - Coverage and Fuzzing

**Date:** *January 13, 2025*  

## Control-Flow Graph (CFG, very brief refer to notes for examples)

A CFG is a graphical representation of the flow of control in a program.

- **Nodes:** Represent zero or more statements.
- **Edges:** Represent possible transitions between statements.

**CFG Construction:**
1. **Lexing:** Converts characters into tokens.
2. **Parsing:** Converts tokens into a concrete syntax tree.
3. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** Cleans up the concrete syntax tree.
4. **CFG Generation:** Converts the AST into a control-flow graph.
5. **Optimizations:** Apply optimizations to the CFG.
6. **Code Generation:** Convert the CFG into bytecode or machine code.

## Basic Blocks

A sequence of instructions with one entry point and one exit point.

- **Maximal Basic Blocks:** Group statements that always execute together.

**Example:** In a loop, the body of the loop forms a basic block.

## Statement & Branch Coverage

- **Statement Coverage:** Fraction of statements (nodes) executed by the test suite.
- **Branch Coverage:** Fraction of branches (edges) taken by the test suite.

**Example:**
Consider the following Python code and test suite:

```python
class Foo:
    def m(self, a, b):
        if a < 0 and b < 0:
            return 4
        elif a < 0 and b > 0:
            return 3
        elif a > 0 and b < 0:
            return 2
        elif a >= 0 and b >= 0:
            return a / b
        raise Exception("I didn't think things through")
```

And the test suite:
```python
import unittest
from foo import Foo

class CoverageTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_one(self):
        f = Foo()
        f.m(1, 2)

    def test_two(self):
        f = Foo()
        f.m(1, -2)

    def test_three(self):
        f = Foo()
        f.m(-1, 2)
```
- **Coverage Report:** The test suite achieves 100% statement coverage but only 75% branch coverage because it doesn't cover the case where both `a` and `b` are negative.

## Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a technique for finding software bugs by feeding random or semi-random inputs to a program.

### Types of Fuzzing:

1. **Mutation-Based Fuzzing:** Randomly modifies existing inputs.
2. **Generation-Based Fuzzing:**  Generates inputs based on a grammar or model.

### Fuzzing Workflow

1. Generate random inputs.
2. Feed inputs to the program.
3. Observe crashes, assertion failures, or runtime errors.

### Levels of Fuzzing (for C Programs)

1. Sequence of ASCII characters;
2. Sequence of words, separators, and white space (gets past the lexer);
3. Syntactically correct C program (gets past the parser);
4. Type-correct C program (gets past the type checker);
5. Ttatically conforming C program (starts to exercise optimizations);
6. Dynamically conforming C program;
7. Model conforming C program.

Fuzzing runs automatically and really works, but without significant work, it won’t find sophisticated domain-specific issues.


## Key Takeaways

- **Code Coverage:** Use statement and branch coverage to ensure that your tests are comprehensive and target critical paths in your code.

- **Fuzzing:** Fuzzing is an effective technique for uncovering bugs, by feeding the program random or semi-random input.

- **Control Flow Graphs:** Represent the flow of control in a program, and are used to calculate coverage metrics.

# Lecture 4 - Mutation Analysis

**Date:** *January 15, 2025*  

Mutation analysis helps determine if a test suite is effective by checking whether it detects small changes (mutations) in the code. These changes, called *mutants*, simulate real-world programming mistakes.

## Concept

- A **mutant** is a modified version of the original program.
- A **test suite** is considered effective if it can **kill** mutants, meaning the output of the test differs when run on the mutant versus the original.
- Mutation analysis is essentially **fuzzing the test suite** to ensure it catches errors.

## Example of Mutants

### Original Code
```c
int min(int a, int b) {
    int minVal = a;
    if (b < a) {
        minVal = b;
    }
    return minVal;
}
```

### Mutant Variations
```c
minVal = b;       // ∆ 1
if (b > a) {      // ∆ 2
if (b < minVal) { // ∆ 3
BOMB();           // ∆ 4
minVal = a;       // ∆ 5
minVal = failOnZero(b); // ∆ 6
```

- **Test Case Example:** A test suite with `(a=0, b=1, expected=0)` might detect some mutants but miss others.
- **Equivalent Mutants:** Some mutants don’t change behavior, making them undetectable. (∆ 3)

## Mutation Analysis Workflow

1. **Generate Mutants** - Apply mutation operators (small code changes) to create mutants.
2. **Execute Mutants** - Run the test suite on each mutant.
3. **Classify Mutants**:
   - *Killed*: The test suite detects the mutation.
   - *Survived*: The test suite fails to detect the change.
   - *Equivalent*: The mutant behaves identically to the original.

## Generating Mutants

- **Ground String**: A valid program belonging to the programming language grammar.
- **Mutation Operators:** Rules that specify syntactic variations of strings generated
from a grammar:
  - **Arithmetic operator replacement** (`+` → `-`, `*` → `/`)
  - **Logical connector replacement** (`&&` → `||`)
  - **Relational operator replacement** (`>` → `>=`, `<` → `<=`)
  - **Unary operator deletion** (`!x` → `x`)
  - **Statement removal**
- **Mutant**: The result of applying a mutation operator to a ground string.
- **Mutation Score**: The percentage of killed mutants over total mutants.
- **Strong vs. Weak Mutation**:
  - *Strong*: The test must propagate the error to the output.
  - *Weak*: The test must only cause an internal state change.

Let’s consider mutant ∆1 from above, i.e. we change `minVal = a` to `minVal = b`. In this case:

- reachability: unavoidable;
- infection: need `b  != a`;
- propagation: wrong minVal needs to return to the caller; that is, we can’t execute the body
of the if statement, so we need `b > a`.

A test case for strong mutation is therefore `a = 5`, `b = 7` and for weak mutation `a = 7`, `b = 5`.

Now consider mutant ∆3, which replaces `b < a` with `b < minVal`. This mutant is an equivalent
mutant, since `a = minVal`. (The infection condition boils down to `false` .)

## Key Takeaways

- **Mutation analysis evaluates the effectiveness of test suites.**
- **Good test suites kill a high percentage of mutants.**
- **Statement and branch coverage alone are weak indicators of test quality.**
- **Mutation testing is computationally expensive but provides deep insights into test suite strength.**

# Lecture 5 - Syntax and Semantics

**Date:** *January 20, 2025*

> **Note:** This lecture is a pain in the ass. Consider skipping.

## Operational Semantics

- **SE 212 Recap:** Axiomatic semantics is used to prove program correctness.
- **Alternative approaches:**
  - **Operational Semantics** (used in this course) describes how a program executes step-by-step.
  - **Denotational Semantics** maps programs to mathematical objects.

## The WHILE Language

A simplified imperative language used for reasoning about code.

### Example Program
```while
{ p := 0; x := 1; n := 2 };

while x <= n do {
    x := x + 1;
    p := p + m
};

print_state
```
- Statements are **separated** by `;` (not terminated like in C).
- Variables are implicitly declared.
- No side effects in expressions—effects occur only in statements.

### Syntax Overview

#### **Terminals (Leaf Nodes)**
- `n ∈ Z`: integers
- `true, false ∈ B`: Boolean values
- `x, y ∈ L`: variable locations

#### **Non-Terminals (Internal Nodes)**
- `a ∈ Aexp`: arithmetic expressions
- `b ∈ Bexp`: Boolean expressions
- `s ∈ Stmt`: statements

### **Grammar Rules**
#### **Arithmetic Expressions**
```plaintext
e ::= n | x | -e | e1 aop e2 | (e)

aop ::= + | - | *
```

#### **Boolean Expressions**
```plaintext
b ::= true | false | not b | e1 rop e2 | b1 bop b2 | (b)

rop ::= < | <= | = | >= | >
bop ::= and | or
```

#### **Statements**
```plaintext
s ::= skip | x:=e | if b then s [else s] | while b do s | { slist } | print_state | assert b | assume b | havoc v1, ..., vN

slist ::= s (;s)*

prog ::= slist
```

## **Operational Semantics: Big-Step**
Defines how program execution **transforms** a state.
A state `q` is a mapping from variables to values.
Judgments are written as:

    $$
        \langle e, q \rangle \Downarrow n
    $$
<Caption>
Expression e in state q evaluates to value n.
</Caption>

For statements, the notation is:

$$
\langle s, q \rangle \Downarrow q'
$$

<Caption>
statement s executed in state q results in state q′.
</Caption>
  

### Rules for Arithmetic Expressions (Aexp)

The semantics for arithmetic expressions in WHILE are defined using inference rules. Here are the rules:

#### 1. Constants

$$
\langle n, q \rangle \Downarrow n
$$

- A constant $ n $ evaluates to itself.

#### 2. Variables

$$
\langle x, q \rangle \Downarrow q(x)
$$

- A variable $ x $ evaluates to its value in the current state $ q $.

#### 3. Addition

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 + e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 + n_2
$$

- The sum of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to the sum of their values.

#### 4. Subtraction

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 - e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 - n_2
$$

- The difference of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to the difference of their values.

#### 5. Multiplication

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 * e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 * n_2
$$

- The product of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to the product of their values.

### Rules for Boolean Expressions (Bexp)

Boolean expressions are built on top of arithmetic expressions. Here are the rules:

#### 1. True and False

$$
\langle \text{true}, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{true}
$$
$$
\langle \text{false}, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{false}
$$

- The constants `true` and `false` evaluate to themselves.

#### 2. Equality

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 = e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 = n_2
$$

- The equality of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to whether their values are equal.

#### 3. Less Than or Equal

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 \le e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \leq n_2
$$

- The less-than-or-equal comparison of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to whether $ n_1 $ is less than or equal to $ n_2 $.

#### 4. Logical AND

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 \text{ and } e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \land n_2
$$

- The logical AND of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to the logical conjunction of their values.

#### 5. Logical OR

$$
\langle e_1, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \quad \langle e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_2 \over \langle e_1 \text{ or } e_2, q \rangle \Downarrow n_1 \lor n_2
$$

- The logical OR of two expressions $ e_1 $ and $ e_2 $ evaluates to the logical disjunction of their values.

## Rules for Statements

In big-step semantics, statements transform the state of the program. The notation is:

$$
\langle s, q \rangle \Downarrow q'
$$

- **$ s $**: The statement to be executed.
- **$ q $**: The initial state.
- **$ q' $**: The final state after executing $ s $.

### Notation

- **Empty state**: $ [] $
- **Example state**: $ [x := 10; y := 15; z := 5] $
- **Substitution**: $ q[x := 10] $ (yields a state like $ q $ but with $ x $ bound to $ 10 $).

### Rules for Evaluating Statements

Statements have side effects because they modify the state rather than directly returning a value. Here are the rules for evaluating statements in WHILE:

#### 1. Skip Statement

$$
\langle \text{skip}, q \rangle \Downarrow q
$$

- The `skip` statement does nothing. It simply returns the same state $ q $.

#### 2. Print State

$$
\langle \text{print\_state}, q \rangle \Downarrow q
$$

- The `print_state` statement does not modify the state but may have the side effect of printing the state.

#### 3. Statement Composition

$$
\langle s_1, q \rangle \Downarrow q'' \quad \langle s_2, q'' \rangle \Downarrow q' \over \langle s_1; s_2, q \rangle \Downarrow q'
$$

- The composition $ s_1; s_2 $ executes $ s_1 $ first, resulting in state $ q'' $, and then executes $ s_2 $ in state $ q'' $, resulting in the final state $ q' $.

#### 4. Assignment

$$
\langle e, q \rangle \Downarrow n \over \langle x := e, q \rangle \Downarrow q[x := n]
$$

- The assignment statement $ x := e $ evaluates the expression $ e $ to $ n $ and updates the state $ q $ so that $ x $ is bound to $ n $.

#### 5. If-Then-Else Statement

$$
\langle b, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{true} \quad \langle s_1, q \rangle \Downarrow q' \over \langle \text{if } b \text{ then } s_1 \text{ else } s_2, q \rangle \Downarrow q'
$$

- If the condition $ b $ evaluates to `true`, the `if` statement executes $ s_1 $ and results in state $ q' $.

$$
\frac{\langle b, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{false} \quad \langle s_2, q \rangle \Downarrow q'}{\langle \text{if } b \text{ then } s_1 \text{ else } s_2, q \rangle \Downarrow q'}
$$

- If the condition $ b $ evaluates to `false`, the `if` statement executes $ s_2 $ and results in state $ q' $.

### Example of Evaluating Statements

Consider the compound statement:

$$
p := 0; x := 1; n := 2
$$

We can derive its execution as follows:

1. Evaluate $ p := 0 $ in the empty state $ [] $:
   $$
   \langle 0, [] \rangle \Downarrow 0 \over \langle p := 0, [] \rangle \Downarrow [p := 0]
   $$

2. Evaluate $ x := 1 $ in the state $ [p := 0] $:
   $$
   \langle 1, [p := 0] \rangle \Downarrow 1 \over \langle x := 1, [p := 0] \rangle \Downarrow [p := 0, x := 1]
   $$

3. Evaluate $ n := 2 $ in the state $ [p := 0, x := 1] $:
   $$
   \langle 2, [p := 0, x := 1] \rangle \Downarrow 2 \over \langle n := 2, [p := 0, x := 1] \rangle \Downarrow [p := 0, x := 1, n := 2]
   $$

4. The final state after executing the compound statement is:
   $$
   \langle p := 0; x := 1; n := 2, [] \rangle \Downarrow [p := 0, x := 1, n := 2]
   $$

### Semantics of Loops

The semantics of the `while` statement are defined in two parts:

#### 1. Loop Condition is False

$$
\frac{\langle b, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{false}}{\langle \text{while } b \text{ do } s, q \rangle \Downarrow q}
$$

- If the loop condition $ b $ evaluates to `false`, the `while` statement is equivalent to `skip` and does not modify the state.

#### 2. Loop Condition is True

$$
\frac{\langle b, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{true} \quad \langle s; \text{while } b \text{ do } s, q \rangle \Downarrow q'}{\langle \text{while } b \text{ do } s, q \rangle \Downarrow q'}
$$

- If the loop condition $ b $ evaluates to `true`, the body $ s $ is executed once, and then the `while` loop is executed again in the new state.

#### Non-Terminating Loops

For infinite loops, we introduce a special state $ \top $ (read as "top") to represent divergence:

$$
\langle \text{while true do } s, q \rangle \Downarrow \top
$$

- An infinite loop enters the state $ \top $, and any statement executed in this state remains in $ \top $:
  $$
  \langle s, \top \rangle \Downarrow \top
  $$

- But we don’t get any insight into what happens. Thats where small-step semantics come in to deal with programs that don’t terminate, but produce useful side effects while they are executing.

### Deterministic Semantics

A semantics is **deterministic** if every program statement has at most one possible derivation in any state:

$$
\text{if } \langle s, q \rangle \Downarrow q_1 \text{ and } \langle s, q \rangle \Downarrow q_2 \text{ then } q_1 = q_2.
$$

Two statements are **semantically equivalent** if they produce the same output state given the same input state:

$$
s_1 \text{ and } s_2 \text{ are semantically equivalent if } \forall q. \langle s_1, q \rangle \Downarrow q_1 \text{ and } \langle s_2, q \rangle \Downarrow q_2 \text{ implies } q_1 = q_2.
$$

For example, unrolling a `while` loop yields a semantically equivalent statement:

$$
\text{while } b \text{ do } s \text{ is equivalent to } \text{if } b \text{ then } (s; \text{while } b \text{ do } s) \text{ else skip}.
$$

### Structural Induction

To prove a property $ P $ on all possible derivation trees (e.g., for semantics), we use **structural induction**:

- **Base case**: Prove $ P $ for all axioms.
- **Inductive case**: Assume $ P $ holds for all smaller derivation trees and show that $ P $ continues to hold when applying each possible rule once.

For example, we can prove that the semantics are deterministic using structural induction.

## **Operational Semantics: Small-Step**
Describes **intermediate** execution steps instead of final results.

Judgments are written as:
    $$
        \langle s, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle t, q' \rangle
    $$

- **$ s $**: The current program (or statement) to be executed.
- **$ q $**: The current state (or store) of the program.
- **$ t $**: The remaining program (or statement) after executing one step of $ s $.
- **$ q' $**: The new state after executing one step of $ s $.

If there is no more program left to execute after $ s $, the notation simplifies to:

$$
\langle s, q \rangle \Rightarrow q'
$$
  
    > Essentially peeling off the first statement from s, which
    we execute, and we have a remaining program t to execute


### Rules in Small-Step Semantics

The rules provided in the section describe how different constructs in the WHILE language are executed step-by-step:

#### 1. Skip Statement

$$
\langle \text{skip}, q \rangle \Rightarrow q
$$

- The $skip$ statement does nothing. It simply transitions to the same state $q$ with no further program to execute.

#### 2. Sequential Composition

$$
\langle s_1, q \rangle \Rightarrow q' \over \langle s_1; s_2, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle s_2, q' \rangle
$$

- If executing $s_1$ in state $q$ results in state $q'$, then the program $s_1; s_2$ (which means "execute $s_1$ followed by $s_2$") reduces to $s_2$ in state $q'$.

Alternatively, if $s_1$ reduces to another statement $s_3$:

$$
\langle s_1, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle s_3, q' \rangle \over \langle s_1; s_2, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle s_3; s_2, q' \rangle
$$

- Here, $s_1$ is not fully executed yet, so the remaining program is $s_3; s_2$.

#### 3. If-Then-Else Statement

$$
\langle b, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{true} \over \langle \text{ if } b \text{ then } s_1 \text{ else } s_2, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle s_1, q \rangle
$$

- If the condition $b$) evaluates to `true`, then the `if` statement reduces to $s_1$ (the "then" branch).

Similarly, if $b$ evaluates to `false`:

$$
\frac{\langle b, q \rangle \Downarrow \text{false}}{\langle \text{if } b \text{ then } s_1 \text{ else } s_2, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle s_2, q \rangle}
$$

- If the condition $b$ evaluates to `false`, the `if` statement reduces to $s_2$ (the "else" branch).

#### 4. While Loop

$$
\langle \text{while } b \text{ do } s, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle \text{if } b \text{ then } (s; \text{while } b \text{ do } s) \text{ else skip}, q \rangle
$$

- The `while` loop is transformed into an `if` statement. If the condition $b$ is `true`, the loop body $s$ is executed, followed by the `while` loop again. If $b$ is `false`, the loop reduces to `skip`.

### Example of Small-Step Execution

Consider the program:

$$
\text{while } x > 0 \text{ do } x := x - 1
$$

In small-step semantics, the execution would proceed as follows:

1. The `while` loop is transformed into an `if` statement:
   $$
   \langle \text{while } x > 0 \text{ do } x := x - 1, q \rangle \Rightarrow \langle \text{if } x > 0 \text{ then } (x := x - 1; \text{while } x > 0 \text{ do } x := x - 1) \text{ else skip}, q \rangle
   $$

2. If $ x > 0 $ is `true`, the program reduces to:
   $$
   \langle x := x - 1; \text{while } x > 0 \text{ do } x := x - 1, q \rangle
   $$

3. The assignment $ x := x - 1 $ is executed, updating the state $ q $, and the loop continues.

This step-by-step reduction continues until $ x > 0 $ becomes `false`, at which point the loop reduces to `skip`.


## **Assertions, Assumptions, and Specification**
- `assert`: Ensures a condition holds at a program point.
- `assume`: Restricts program execution to cases where a condition is true.
- `havoc`: Assigns arbitrary values to variables, modeling unknown inputs.

### **Example (Symbolic Execution)**
```c
havoc(x);
assume(x > 10);
y = x + 1;
assert(y > x);
assert(y < 200);
```
- Ensures `y > x` always holds but does **not** guarantee `y < 200`.

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Big-Step Semantics**: Describes how a program executes in a single step.
- **Small-Step Semantics**: Defines transitions between intermediate execution states.
- **Assertions & Assumptions**: Help model program correctness and symbolic execution.
