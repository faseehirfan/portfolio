# Chapter 2 OS: Evolution

Below is a concise study guide that covers the evolution from simple batch systems, to multiprogrammed batch systems, to modern time-sharing systems. It includes scheduling approaches and the key hardware features that enabled each style of system.

## 1. Simple Batch Systems

**Key Ideas**  
- Earliest “organized” operating systems (1950s–early 1960s).  
- Jobs (programs) are collected in batches, each executed **one at a time**.  
- A small “monitor” program (resident monitor or kernel) loads the next job when the current one finishes.

**Goals**  
- Improve utilization compared to purely “serial” processing.  
- Automate job sequencing to reduce setup time.

**Hardware Requirements / Features**  
1. **Memory Protection** – prevent user programs from overwriting the monitor’s memory area.  
2. **Timer** – detect/prevent jobs from running forever.  
3. **Privileged Instructions** – only the OS (in kernel mode) can run these critical instructions.  
4. **Dual-Mode Operation (User vs. Kernel)** – CPU supports user mode for jobs, kernel mode for the OS.

**Scheduling**  
- Typically **FIFO (FCFS)** for each batch.  
- Minimal or no context switching (no preemption).

## 2. Multiprogrammed Batch Systems

**Key Ideas**  
- Evolved to reduce CPU idle time: keep multiple jobs in memory so when one job is blocked on I/O, another can run.

**Goals**  
- Overlap I/O and computation to maximize CPU utilization (improve **throughput**).

**Hardware Requirements / Features**  
1. **More Advanced Memory Management** – must manage multiple programs’ memory at once.  
2. **Interrupt-Driven I/O** – so the CPU can switch to other jobs while one job is waiting for I/O.

**Scheduling**  
- Switch jobs whenever the current job blocks on I/O.  
- Could use **Shortest Job Next**, **Priority Scheduling**, or similar.

## 3. Modern Time-Sharing Systems

**Key Ideas**  
- Designed for interactive multi-user use (e.g., multiple terminals).  
- Each user experiences quick response times, as if each has a dedicated machine.

**Goals**  
- **Fast response** for many concurrent users.  
- **Fairness**: ensure no single process/user monopolizes the CPU.

**Hardware / OS Features**  
1. **Time Slicing** – a clock interrupt triggers context switches at short intervals.  
2. **Advanced Memory Management** – typically uses virtual memory.  
3. **Protection & Security** – needed for multi-user isolation.  
4. **Preemptive Scheduling** – forcibly context-switch processes to ensure responsiveness.

**Scheduling**  
- Often **Round-Robin** (each process gets a small time quantum).  
- May combine with priority-based preemption or other algorithms.

## Scheduling Examples

- **FIFO / FCFS:** First-come, first-served, no preemption. Common in simple batch.  
- **Round Robin:** Divides CPU time into small quanta and cycles through processes. Common in time-sharing.  
- **Priority Scheduling:** Highest-priority process runs first (careful of starvation).  
- **Shortest Job First / Shortest Remaining Time:** Minimizes average wait time in batch systems (needs job-length estimates).

## Key Takeaways

1. **Simple Batch** – Single job runs at a time until completion. Minimal concurrency.  
2. **Multiprogramming (Batch)** – Multiple jobs in memory; CPU is kept busy by switching to another job when one blocks.  
3. **Time-Sharing** – Extends multiprogramming with time-slicing and multi-user support; strong protection and preemptive scheduling ensure responsiveness.
